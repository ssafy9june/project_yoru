Learned how to make HTML files.
I am recalling my experience from SSAFY.

Learned about div tags, display and many more.
I already learned about HTML and also have experience with JS, TS, React, Vue.
However, after learning and using those frameworks/libraries and coming back to the basic(HTML),
it gives me new perspectives on coding.
